Reverse Engineering notes for now:

Single shot brew temp: ~180 F
Steam temp: ~205 F at valve, ~230F at boiler
NTC 100k(?) Thermistor
- ~114kOhm at ~22.5C
CMS79FT738 MCU
13 x 6 cm board
3/16” OD, 1/8”(?) ID tubing

Why is OPV before boiler? Where to put actual pressure sensor?

Label says 1350W power consumption, 120VAC 60Hz

Board mounting screw:
30-23.5‎ = 6.5 from edge of hole to edge of hole
Right side hole positioned at 3.5cm from top, 2.5mm from right side of board (to middle of hole)
